I've created a little TTRPG Shadowrun Tool for a Data Terminal, that players can use to look up Information
The main file is a HTML5 file that contains the Terminal
Once the terminal is open, they need to upload a .dat file (encrypted TXT file) that contains all the entries possible
In the Github Repository are also two other HTML5 files to help with creating the .dat files. You can either write your own txt file with the same formatting and then use the encoder.html to turn it into .dat or you can use the fancier database-editor.html with a little GUI to create entries for the database file.

I've also added two minigames to the terminal that are hidden by codewords and there is an administrator password that unlocks additional options inside the terminal

I will encrypt the codewords in binary so in case my players look at this Git, they don't just stumble upon the solution (I've warned you my players! Don't ruin the fun by cheating)
